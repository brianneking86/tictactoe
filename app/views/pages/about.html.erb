<h3>About Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<p>* starts with a blank 3 x 3 grid</p>
<p>* player X starts by putting an X in any blank space</p>
<p>* computer O responds by putting an O in a blank space</p>
<p>* Player X then places the next X in another blank space ideally to try to make 3 in a row</p>
<p>* Player and computer continue placing Xs and Os until one of them gets three in a row or the board fills up. If neither gets three in a row, its a tie game</p>
